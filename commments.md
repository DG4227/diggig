Great work!
+ Duplicate stores? You guys are wild.
+ Suggest breaking out ajax into adapter. Overall, move logic from app.js into other files
+ Suggest creating a separate render function to append HTML to DOM
+ Circular logic in constructors that call other constructors. Suggest calling them all from a central place
+ Very nice CSS design!
