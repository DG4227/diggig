She'd gone once, twice, three times and only wanted to say one thing really - that she realized that there is such a thing as a soul. She hadn't known before, but now she knew that the soul does exist. There's something very beautiful in that. It was worth making Véronique for that girl. It was worth working for a year, sacrificing all that money, energy, time, patience, torturing yourself, killing yourself, making thousands of decisions, so that one young girl in Paris should realize that there is such a thing as a soul.

We're abysmally ignorant, about both ourselves and others. There's a lot of loose talk nowadays to the effect that children should be brought up to know all about brotherhood and understanding and coexistence and equality and everything else that's all the rage just now. But it doesn't dawn on anyone that we must first learn something about ourselves and our own feelings... How can you understand other people if you don't know anything about yourself?

Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves and what they identify with themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be.

If you're going to try, go all the way. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe your mind...it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean...mockery, isolation...a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.

It’s like fishing: You just wait... It’s like I always say, “The chef cooks the fish, the chef doesn’t make the fish.” Desire is the bait, the fish is caught, and then the chef cooks it. Ideas are like fish. They just come to you sometimes, and when you’re really lucky, you fall in love with them and know exactly what to do."`, `Salvador Dali //`, `Salvador Dali // "Where is the real? All appearance are deceitful, the visible surface is deceptive. I look at my hand...it is nerves, muscles, bones. Let us go deeper: it is molecules and acids.

A genuinely creative piece of work always declines to see the world as others see it, or as it is commonly described... Sometimes this forced change of perspective provokes delight, and a Creative should count herself extremely lucky if that turns out to be the case. But she should also prepare herself for the more usual reactions: discomfort, distaste, confusion, shock — even anger. The genuinely new rarely slips easily into the world-as-it-is. It causes at least a little friction."`, `Pablo Picasso //`, `Pablo Picasso // "Imagination is real."`, `Albert Einstein //`, `Albert Einstein // "People like you and I, though mortal of course like everyone else, do not grow old no matter how long we live...we never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into which we were born."`, `John Lennon (& Yoko Ono) //`, `John Lennon (& Yoko Ono) // "Make your own dream. That's the Beatles' story, isn't it? That's Yoko's story, that's what I'm saying now. Produce your own dream... It's quite possible to do anything, but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters. Don't expect Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan or John Lennon or Yoko Ono or Bob Dylan or Jesus Christ to come and do it for you. You have to do it yourself. That's what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began. They can point the way, leave signposts and little instructions in various books...the instructions are all there for all to see, have always been and always will be. There's nothing new under the sun. All the roads lead to Rome... people cannot provide it for you. I can't wake you up. You can wake you up. I can't cure you. You can cure you."`, `Edward Norton //`, `Edward Norton // "I'm fascinated by the ways in which people express themselves, because their responses are often counter to what they're actually feeling. Like when they're frightened, they tend to freeze. When they're angry, it doesn't always come out as volume. There are wonderful contradictions in the way that people express their emotions."`, `Coco Chanel //`, `Coco Chanel // "Hard times arouse an instinctive desire for authenticity."`, `Christina Ricci //`, `Christina Ricci // "As long as we can tell stories about our ability to survive, the more we will hope, not self-destruct."`, `Lawrence Krauss //`, `Lawrence Krauss // "Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded...the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand.

Beautiful people do not just happen."`, `Gertrude Stein //`, `Gertrude Stein // "A very important thing is not to make up your mind that you are any one thing."`, `Charlie Chaplin //`, `Charlie Chaplin // "To those who can hear me, I say — do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed — the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish... You, the people, have the power... Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth the future and old age a security... Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness...let us all unite!"`, `Ernest Hemingway //`, `Ernest Hemingway // "Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep, really to sleep.

They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them – words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out."`, `Wendell Berry //`, `Wendell Berry // "We have lived our lives by the assumption that what was good for us would be good for the world. We have been wrong. We must change our lives so that it will be possible to live by the contrary assumption, that what is good for the world will be good for us. And that requires that we make an effort to know the world..."`, `Johnny Cash //`, `Johnny Cash // "You can ask the people around me.

You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.

Because I thought I should be beautiful... And they said to me, 'That's as good as it gets.' It was at that moment I had an epiphany, and I went home and started crying... I said I have to make this picture...because I think I am an interesting woman when I look at myself on screen. And I know that if I met myself at a party, I would never talk to that character because she doesn't fulfill physically the demands that we're brought up to think women have to have...

But if you can accept that you have little piranhas attached to your ankles, you know they can never nibble up much further than your knees. There's always going to be people who don't like what you're doing and people who might love what you're doing. If you can find acceptance and know that things aren't perfect, that you make mistakes in public, that you get embarrassed, that you make a fool of yourself and that you take risks – then you just keep going.

The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together...a great mind is androgynous.
